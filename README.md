**Anticipating Heart Disease Trends: A Predictive Analysis of US Mortality Rates**

This project seeks to conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of heart disease and stroke mortality rates among U.S. adults aged 35 and older from 2000 to 2019. The project will not only analyze historical trends but also develop predictive models to forecast future mortality rates. By examining demographic factors such as age, race/ethnicity, and sex, as well as geographic variations across counties, the project aims to uncover significant patterns and project potential future outcomes.

# Task 2: Data Exploration and Analysis: 
The analysis of the cleaned health dataset reveals significant insights into mortality rates associated with heart disease and stroke across various demographics in the United States. It encompasses three key tasks like data exploration, data transformation and analysis report. In data transformation, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and outliers. Data transformation involves preparing the data for detailed analysis by creating new variables, aggregating data, and performing preliminary statistical analysis. And the last part is analysis write-up, where we drafted a summary of our major findings and discuss their implications. This structured approach aims to provide valuable insights into mortality trends based on certain attributes like gender, age, race, cause of death. By examining trends over time, demographic disparities, and geographical variations, we can draw meaningful conclusions that may inform public health strategies and policies. The analysis of mortality rates related to heart disease and stroke across various demographics in the United States has uncovered critical trends and disparities that have significant public health implications. Addressing these issues through targeted interventions, a focus on health equity, and continued research will be essential in reducing the burden of these diseases and improving health outcomes for all Americans.
